# Simon-Challenge

- Learnt JavaScript a lot better!

- Also learnt how to use jQuery framework effectively

- HTML and CSS files were set up for me, so was only practising JavaScript and jQUery skills
-
- I found this project particularly challenging and took me some time to complete. I ran into a lot of bugs and errors and had to spend many hours debugging using the chrome developer tools and searching on stack overflow for how to perform certain lines of code!

- Overall, I managed to achieve what I wanted to build and as a result I massively developed my basic JavaScript and jQuery skills! :)
